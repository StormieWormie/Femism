# Femism
This is a good example of how not to implement a fourth order PDE using the finite element method with hat-functions. For a better implementation, look at [Plate Deformation](https://github.com/StormieWormie/PlateDeformation).

### So why does this repo still exist?
The model of a membrane with curvature-inducing proteins is described here but the biggest reason is that this was my Bacholr's thesis project which holds a special place in my heart as it was my first ever implementation of the finite element method.
